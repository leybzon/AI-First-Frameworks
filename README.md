Welcome to **AI-First Software Frameworks**, a collaborative repository dedicated to advancing the principles and practices of AI-first architecture in software development.

## What is AI-First Architecture?

In the evolving landscape of technology, adopting an **AI-first architecture** means integrating artificial intelligence at the core of software design and development. This approach prioritizes AI capabilities from the outset, ensuring that applications are inherently intelligent, adaptive, and capable of learning from data. Unlike traditional methods where AI is an add-on, AI-first design embeds intelligence into the very fabric of software systems, enabling proactive and personalized user experiences. citeturn0search4
